<h1><a name="section001190000000000000000"></a><a name="trans-bin"></a>
Binary books</h1>

<p>In section&nbsp;<a href="node80.html#trans-books">9.1</a>, it was
mentioned that some books contain data in a compact form which is not
usually human-readable.  Most large books, especially those containing
design figures in the engineering sciences as well as books containing
the payroll data for a number of employees, will be stored in this
form.  They are called binary books<a name="5857"></a>.</p>

<p>Algol&nbsp;68 allows you to write anything to binary books, just
as for text books. Indeed, you can write an integer and a character to
a binary book and then read back the data as a character followed by
an integer.  The results may not be particularly meaningful, but you
can do it.</p>

<p>The only difference between transput to, or from, binary books is
that instead of using the procedures <tt>put</tt><a name="6029"></a>
and <tt>get</tt><a name="6030"></a>, you use the procedures <tt>put
bin</tt><a name="6031"></a> and <tt>get bin</tt><a name="6032"></a>.
The modes accepted by these procedures are identical with those
accepted by <code>put</code> and <code>get</code> respectively except
that you cannot transput procedures with mode</p>

<pre>
   PROC(REF FILE)BOOL
</pre>

<p>Here is a program which will output the data produced by the
program in the last exercise:</p>

<pre>
   PROGRAM binary CONTEXT VOID
   USE standard
   BEGIN
     FILE f;

     IF establish(f,
                  "pipowers",
                  stand out channel)/=0
     THEN
       put(stand error,
           ("Cannot create pipowers",
            newline));
       stop
     FI;

     FOR i TO 10
     DO
       put bin(f,(i,pi**i))
     OD;
     close(f)
   END
   FINISH
</pre>

<p>Run the program and then look at the book it has produced. Compare
it with the data produced by the program in the last exercise.</p>

<p> Values of mode <code>REF STRING</code> can be read by <tt>get
bin</tt><a name="6033"></a>, but you should remember to set the string
terminator using the procedure <tt>make term</tt><a name="6034"></a>.
However, you should note that the string terminator will
<span class="textit">always</span> include the character
<tt>lf</tt><a name="6035"></a>. Furthermore, if <tt>set
possible</tt><a name="6036"></a> is <tt>FALSE</tt><a name="6037"></a>
for the <tt>REF FILE</tt><a name="6038"></a> on which transput is
being performed, the terminator will have been read when the routine
<tt>get bin</tt><a name="6039"></a> returns. If <tt>set
possible</tt><a name="6040"></a> is <tt>TRUE</tt><a name="6041"></a>
for that <tt>REF FILE</tt><a name="6042"></a>, then the terminator
will not have been read.</p>

<p>Another aspect of binary books is that of being able to
browse<a name="5891"></a>. The principal procedure provided for this
purpose is <tt>set</tt><a name="6043"></a> which has the header</p>

<pre>
   PROC set=(REF FILE f,INT p,l,c)VOID:
</pre>

<p>The last three parameters specify the position in the book where
you want to start browsing, whether reading or writing. The QAD
transput provided with the a68toc<a name="6044"></a> compiler ignores
the <code>p</code> and <code>l</code> parameters because it regards a
file as consisting of one page of one line.<a name="tex2html32"
href="footnode.html#foot5897"><sup><span
class="arabic">10</span>.<span class="arabic">5</span></sup></a></p>

<p>There are two other related procedures.  One is
<tt>reset</tt><a name="6045"></a> which has the header</p>

<pre>
   PROC reset=(REF FILE f)VOID:
</pre>

<p>and is equivalent to <code>set(f,0,0,0)</code>. One possible use of
this procedure is to output data to a book, then use
<code>reset</code> followed by <code>get</code> to read the data from
the book. The sort of book used in this way is often called a <b>work
file</b><a name="5903"></a> (in operating system terms). Such a book
contains data of use while a program is being elaborated, but is
deleted at the end of the program.  In fact, every program has such a
book whose controlling <code>FILE</code> is called <code>stand
back</code>. It uses the <code>stand back channel</code> and is
deleted when the program has finished. However, you can write to it,
reset it, then read the contents and copy them to another book.  Note
that the procedure <code>read bin</code> is equivalent to <code>get
bin(stand back,...)</code> and the procedure <code>write bin</code> is
equivalent to <code>put bin(standback,...)</code>.</p>

<p>The other related procedure is <tt>logical
end</tt><a name="6046"></a> which has the header</p>

<pre>
   PROC logical end = (REF FILE f)INT:
</pre>

<p>and yields the value of the position at the end of the book, which
is the size of the book. The position can be set to the end of the
book by writing</p>

<pre>
   set(f,0,0,logical end(f))
</pre>

<p>Here is a procedure which opens an existing book and sets the writing
position to its end, then writes data to the end of the book:</p>

<pre>
   PROC debug=(REF FILE dbg,[]SIMPLOUT st)VOID:
   (
     open(dbg,idf(dbg),stand back channel);
     set(dbg,0,0,logical end(dbg));
     put(dbg,st);
     close(dbg)
   )
</pre>

<p>We shall use this procedure in chapter&nbsp;12 to store data about
the running of a program while we are developing it. Notice that
textual data is written to the book even though the procedures
<code>set</code> and <code>logical end</code> are used.  The point is
that binary and textual data can be mixed in any book which allows
binary transput<a name="5912"></a>.</p>

<p>In the QAD standard prelude, the current position in a book can be
obtained from the procedure <tt>current pos</tt><a name="6047"></a>
which has the header</p>

<pre>
   PROC current pos = (REF FILE f)POS:
</pre>

<p>This particular procedure is very useful if you want to store the
book position of the beginning of a group of data in a book (such a
group is often called a <b>record</b><a name="5918"></a>).  In the QAD
standard prelude, <code>POS</code> is a synonym for
<code>INT</code>.</p>
