Trees</h1>

<p>Both queues and trees are examples of recursive
structures<a name="7912"></a>. Queues contain only one link between
individual structures, trees contain at least two.  Trees are another
kind of linked-list<a name="7913"></a> and are interesting because
they give more examples of how recursive procedures<a name="7914"></a>
are used to manipulate recursively-defined data structures.</p>

<p>There are two principal kinds of trees<a name="7915"></a> in common
use: B-trees and binary trees. B-trees<a name="7916"></a> (sometimes
called <b>balanced trees</b><a name="7918"></a>) are too advanced to
be described here.</p>

<p>A binary tree consists of a number of forks, usually called
<b>nodes</b><a name="7920"></a>, which are linked with two links per
node.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a small tree:</p>

<div align="center"><img align="bottom" border="0"
 src="ch11-10.png" alt="ch11-10.png">
</div>

<p>The topmost node is called the <b>root</b><a name="7925"></a>
(trees are usually depicted upside-down<a name="tex2html39"
href="footnode.html#foot7994"><sup><span
class="arabic">12</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span></sup></a>).
Each node consists of three parts: the data which each node bears and
left and right references which can refer to other nodes. In the small
tree shown above, there are seven nodes on five levels. There are 4
nodes on the left branch of the root and 2 on the right, so that the
tree is unbalanced.</p>

<p>A binary tree is particularly suitable for the ordering of data:
that is, for arranging data in a predefined order<a name="tex2html40"
href="footnode.html#foot7928"><sup><span
class="arabic">12</span>.<span class="arabic">3</span></sup></a>. In
the previous section, in procedure <code>insert fan</code>, we
considered inserting a fan into a queue in ascending order of ticket
number. This is an inefficient way of ordering data. For example,
suppose there are 100 fans in the queue.  Then, on average, we can
expect to insert a fan halfway down the queue; which means 50
comparisons of ticket numbers. If the fans were stored as a balanced
binary tree, the maximum number of comparisons would be only 7
(because <span class="math">2<sup>6</sup> &lt; 100 &lt;
2<sup>7</sup></span>).  For larger numbers, the difference between the
two kinds of linked-list is even more marked.  For 1000 fans, a queue
would need 500 comparisons on average, whereas a balanced binary tree
would need 10 at most. While it is true that these figures are minima
(they assume that the tree is balanced<a name="7929"></a>, that is,
that there are as many nodes to the left of the root as to the right),
nevertheless, on average, a binary tree is much more efficient than a
queue for ordering data.</p>

<p>Here is a typical mode declaration for a binary tree:</p>

<pre>
   MODE WORD = STRUCT(STRING wd,
                      INT ct,
                      REAL fq),
        TREE = STRUCT(REF WORD w,
                      REF TREE left,right);
</pre>

<p>The mode of the data in the declaration of <code>TREE</code> is <tt>REF
WORD</tt> so that if an item of data is moved around, it is only the
reference which is moved. This is more efficient than moving the data
item itself.</p>

<p>We shall give two example tree procedures: adding an item of data to
the tree and printing the tree. We need to check whether the tree at
some node is empty. For this, we use the declaration</p>

<pre>
   REF TREE leaf = NIL
</pre>

<p>Here is the procedure <code>add word</code>:</p>

<pre>
   PROC add word = (REF REF TREE root,
                    REF WORD w)VOID:
   IF   root IS leaf
   THEN root:=HEAP TREE:=(w,leaf,leaf)
   ELIF wd OF w &lt; wd OF w OF root
   THEN add word(left OF root,w)
   ELIF wd OF w &gt; wd OF w OF root
   THEN add word(right OF root,w)
   ELSE ct OF w OF root+:=1
   FI
</pre>

<p>The ordering relation in <code>add word</code> is the alphabetical
ordering of the string in each data item. When the string in the data
item to be added to the tree has been found in the tree, the
occurrence number is incremented by&nbsp;1 (see the <code>ELSE</code>
clause above).  Note the use of recursion<a name="7937"></a>.</p>

<p>Printing the tree follows a similar pattern, but when the &ldquo;root&rdquo; under
consideration is a leaf, nothing happens:</p>

<pre>
   PROC print tree=(REF FILE f,
                    REF REF TREE root)VOID:
   IF   root ISNT leaf
   THEN print tree(f,left OF root);
        put(f,(wd OF w OF root,
               ct OF w OF root,
               newline));
        print tree(f,right OF root)
   FI
</pre>

<p>As you can see, recursion is vital here. Although it is true that
recursion can be avoided by using a loop, recursion is better because
it clarifies the logic.</p>

<p>The allocation and release of memory for linked-lists (including
trees) are quite transparent to the program.  When a tree is read, and
nodes possibly deleted, all the lost memory is collected every so
often by a <b>garbage collector</b><a name="7941"></a>.  You do not
have to worry about the details of memory maintenance--it is all done
for you by the compiler and the run-time system.  If you write a
program which relies heavily on global generators, then you should
allocate extra memory to the heap (see the on-line information for
details of how to use the Algol 68 compilation
system<a name="7942"></a>).</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>11.24<a name="ex-xi-xxiv"></a>
<dd>Write a program which reads a text book and creates a binary tree
containing the number of occurrences of each of the letters A-Z and
a-z (that is, case is significant). Print a report with the frequency
of occurrence represented by a percentage of the total number of
letters in the book to 2 decimal places. You should print the letters
going downwards with 13 lines for each column: first the upper case
letters, then the lower case. Only print lines for those letters which
occur in the book (use <code>mem channel</code> to build the complete table in
memory before printing). Ans<a href="node145.html#ans-xi-xxiv"><img  align="bottom" border="1" alt="[*]" src="answer.png"></a>
