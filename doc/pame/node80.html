Books, channels and files</h1>

<p>In Algol&nbsp;68 terms, external values are held in a
<span class="textbf">book</span><a name="5511"></a>. Books have
various properties. They usually have an identification
string<a name="5512"></a>. Some books can be read, some written to and
some permit both reading<a name="5513"></a> and
writing<a name="5514"></a>.  Some books allow you to
browse<a name="5515"></a>: that is, they allow you to start anywhere
and read (or write) from that point on.  If browsing is allowed, you
can restart<a name="5516"></a> at the beginning. Some books allow you
to store external values in text form (human-readable form) only,
while others allow you to store values in a compact internal form
known as <b>binary</b><a name="5518"></a>.  In the latter form, values
are stored more or less in the same form as they are held in the
program.  The values will not usually be human-readable, being more
suited to fast access by computer programs.</p>

<p>In operating-system<a name="5519"></a> terms, Algol&nbsp;68 books
are called &ldquo;files<a name="5520"></a>&rdquo; (just to confuse
you, of course), but a book has a wider meaning than an
operating-system file.<a name="tex2html28"
href="footnode.html#foot5977"><sup><span
class="arabic">10</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span></sup></a> When
reading external values from the keyboard<a name="5522"></a>, your
program is reading data from a read-only book<a name="5523"></a>.
When printing data, your program is writing data to a write-only
book<a name="5524"></a>.  When accessing a device, such as
<code>/dev/ttyS2</code>, to which you can attach a modem, your program
can both read from and write to the book, but it cannot browse in
it.</p>

<p>The <b>data</b><a name="5526"></a> (as external values are called)
in a book, or the data to be put in a book, travels between the book
and your program via a <b>channel</b>.  Three principal channels are
provided in the standard prelude<a name="5528"></a>: <tt>stand in
channel</tt><a name="5978"></a>, <tt>stand out
channel</tt><a name="5979"></a> and <tt>stand back
channel</tt><a name="5980"></a>.  The first is used for books which
can only be read (they are
&ldquo;read-only<a name="5535"></a>&rdquo;), the second for books
which can only be written to (they are
&ldquo;write-only<a name="5536"></a>&rdquo;) and the last for books
which permit both reading and writing.  This classification is a
little over-simplified.  Many books permit both reading and writing,
but you may only want your program to read it. The three standard
channels mentioned are all &ldquo;buffered&rdquo;. This means that
when you, for example, write data to a book, the data is collected in
memory until a fixed amount has been transput, when the collection is
written to the book in its entirety.  The standard channels use a
buffer of 4096 bytes.  The mode of a channel is
<tt>CHANNEL</tt><a name="5981"></a> and is declared in the standard
prelude.</p>

<p> Your program keeps track of where you are in a book, which book is
being accessed and whether you have come to the end of the book by
means of a special structure which has the mode
<tt>FILE</tt><a name="5982"></a>. This is a complicated structure
declared in the standard prelude. The internals of values of mode
<code>FILE</code> are likely to change from time to time, but the
methods of using them will remain the same.</p>
