<h1><a name="section001430000000000000000"></a><a name="dev-lf"></a>
A simple utility</h1>

<p>When you are writing computer programs, it is very useful to be
able to copy your Algol&nbsp;68 source programs to a printer with line
numbers.  Many editors, including <code>vim</code>, <code>Emacs</code>
and <code>FTE</code>, use line numbers. When the Algol&nbsp;68
compiler finds an error in your program, it displays the offending
line together with its number and a descriptive message on the screen
and the number of the character in the line where the error occurred.
However, it is insufficient to merely copy the contents of a file to
the printer (unless you are using the spooling facility of a header
file) because the output will not contain any identifying
information.</p>

<p>What is required is a small program which will optionally write
line numbers and which will write the name of the file being printed
together with the date and time at which the file was last modified.
A page number is another useful item as it prevents pages being lost
when the listing is made on separate sheets of paper. It would also be
very useful to be able to specify where in a file a listing should
start and where it should finish. Such a program is called a
<b>utility</b><a name="8580"></a>. Notice that the program must be
able to handle zero-length lines as well as lines which are too long
to be printed on one line alone. Lastly, some editors allow you to
insert tab characters into your document, so the utility must be able
to print the file with the correct indentation.</p>

<p>The preceding problem analysis shows that we could write such a
program if we knew how to obtain the date and time of last
modification of a file from the operating system. In the directory
<code>/usr/share/doc/algol68toc/</code>, you will find the source of
the program <code>lf</code> which solves the problem described above
for the Linux operating system. The source of <code>lf</code> is 526
lines long.  Compile it and run it with the
argument<a name="8581"></a> <code>-h</code>. The help information
displayed by a program should be displayed by every program you write
which is used at the command line: it prevents accidental use from
causing damage to your operating system files or directories.</p>

<h2><a name="section001431000000000000000"></a><a name="dev-code"></a>
The source code</h2>

<p>There are many ways of tackling the understanding of a program, but
here is a method which does help with Algol 68 programs. In
summary,</p>

<ol>
<li>See what the program does.
</li>
<li>Look at the principal processing.
</li>
<li>Examine the mode declarations.
</li>
<li>Examine the routines.
</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2-4 for each routine.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Stage one of examining a program is to see what it does. Examples
of its output, and possibly its input, help you to identify the
actions of various parts of the program. Documentation of the input
and output would suffice, but neither exists in this case because the
input is a plain text file and the output is better seen than
described. Compile the Algol 68 example program <code>lf</code> in</p>

<pre>
   /usr/share/doc/a68toc/examples
</pre>

<p>and use it to list the file <code>test.lf</code> (in the same
directory) with line numbers on your printer using the command</p>

<pre>
   lf -pg -n test.lf | lpr
</pre>

<p>to pipe the output to the printer unless you have a LaserJet 4 or
6L when you can omit the <code>-pg</code> argument.  Notice that the
time and date the file was last modified appears at the top of each
page, together with the identifier of the file and the page number. If
you used the <code>-n</code> parameter to print the test file, each
line will be preceded by a line number and a colon.  If you did not
list the file with line numbers, do so now because the line numbers
will highlight another feature of the program. The first line in
<code>test.lf</code> is too long to be printed on one line, so the
program breaks it into two parts.  The second part does not have a
line number since it is part of the same line in the input.</p>

<p>The second stage in understanding a program is to look at the
principal processing. Since procedures and other values must be
declared before use in the a68toc<a name="8591"></a> compiler, the
last part of the program contains the main processing
logic<a name="8592"></a>.  Now print (or display) the source of
<code>lf.a68</code> using the command</p>

<pre>
   lf -n /usr/share/doc/a68toc/pame/lf.a68
</pre>

<p>In the source, the main processing logic is on lines 427-517.
Examine those lines now.</p>

<p>Before processing any command line arguments, the program defines
the actions to take when the last argument has been read. In other
words, what should be done when the logical end of file has been
reached for <code>comm line</code>. The default action is to terminate
the program immediately with a suitable error message. In
<code>lf</code>, no identification is given for <code>comm line</code>
in the <code>open</code> procedure, because it isn't relevant, but if
you insert such an identification, for example, <code>command line
file</code>, then any error message issued by the transput system will
include it. Notice that although the anonymous procedure used as the
second parameter for <code>on logical file end</code> on line 448
occurs within the <code>IF ... FI</code> clause, because it is a
denotation (a procedure denotation) it has global scope. That is one
of the reasons why anonymous procedures are so useful. Also note the
use of <tt>SKIP</tt><a name="8677"></a> to yield a value of mode
<code>BOOL</code>: in fact, it will never be used because
<tt>stop</tt><a name="8678"></a> is a synonym for <code>GOTO end of
program</code>.</p>

<p>In lines 442-517, the program processes the command line argument
by argument. If an argument starts with &ldquo;-&rdquo; it is assumed
to be an option otherwise it is assumed to be a filename. Note the use
of <code>skip terminators</code> to skip spaces in the command line.
Options that require a number (<code>-s</code> and <code>-t</code>)
expect it to follow the option directly (see lines 493 and 495). Lines
500-506 process a solitary <code>-</code> to mean &ldquo;list the
standard input&rdquo;. Lines 507-516 process a named file. As you
examine the code, underline the identifiers of all procedure
calls.</p>

<p>The next stage in understanding a program is to look at all the
mode declarations<a name="8599"></a>.  There are three in this
program: <code>PRINTER</code>, <code>SEC</code> and <code>STAT</code>.
You should scan the program to see what identifiers have that or a
related mode and where they are used.</p>

<h2><a name="section001432000000000000000"></a><a name="dev-rout"></a>
Routines</h2>

<p>Finally, you need to examine the routines declared. It is a good
idea, especially in a more complicated program, to list the
identifiers of all procedures with nested declarations of procedures
indented under their parent procedure identifiers. This helps to fix
the structure of the program in your mind. Then you should examine the
procedures used in the main processing loop.  In <code>lf</code>, they
are:</p>

<div align="center">
<table border="0">
   <tr>
      <td>char in string</td><td>help</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>close</td><td>open</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>disp error</td><td>print</td>
   <tr>
      <td>get</td><td>print file</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>get mtime</td><td>process file name</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>get numeric arg</td><td>reset parameters</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>get sections</td><td>skip terminators</td>
   </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>When you examine each procedure, do the same as you did for the
whole program: first the main logic, then the modes, then the
procedures and operators. You will need to backtrack several times in
a large program. If a lot of names are declared, prepare a list
together with a description of what each name is used for, where it is
declared and the places where it is used. A cross-reference program
would be really useful, but it is not a simple program to write for
Algol&nbsp;68.</p>

<p>The principle processing is performed by the procedure
<code>print</code> <code>file</code> on lines 258-322. Firstly, tab
stops are set according to the current value of <code>tabs</code>,
then <code>lines</code> is initialised and an initialisation string
output to the printer. If letter quality has been chosen (option
<code>-q</code>), a special string is sent to the printer accordingly.
Then the <code>logical</code> <code>file</code> <code>end</code> event
procedure is set. Each section specified on the command line (or the
default section if no sections were specified) is then printed using
the procedure <code>do line</code>. Each line is input using <code>get
line</code> whose principal function is to expand tab characters to
the required number of spaces (3 unless set by the <code>-t</code>
option). Lines are not output until the <code>beg OF ss</code> line is
reached (1 unless set by the <code>-s</code> option). Notice the code
following <code>FROM</code> in the preamble to the inner <code>DO ...
OD</code> loop (on lines 313-316) which ensures that the file is reset
if the sections to be printed are not ordered (the definition of
ordered is in the procedure <code>get sections</code> (lines
381-425).</p>

<p>Similar to your list of nested procedures, prepare a list of
procedures where indented procedures identify procedures called by
the parent procedure. Here is part of the list for
<code>lf</code>:</p>

<pre>
   fstat
      linux fstat
   help
      exit, newline, put
   reset parameters
   lf print
      ODD, print
   get mtime
      fstat, linux ctime
   get sections
      +:=
      add section
         char in string
         get numeric arg
      char in string
</pre>

<h2><a name="section001433000000000000000"></a><a name="dev-dry"></a>
Dry-running example</h2>

<p>The procedure <code>get line</code> (lines 232-250) and its
associated procedures <code>set tabs</code> (lines 220-224) and
<code>tab pos</code> (lines 226-227) are worth examining in detail.
The best way to see how they work is to dry-run them.  Take a blank
sheet of paper and make a vertical list of all the names, both local
and global, used<a name="8610"></a> by the procedures. Opposite
<code>in line</code>, write a piece of text containing tab characters
(a piece of indented program, for example).  Then work your way
through the procedure, marking the value referenced by each name as
you complete each step.  You should also note the value of each
non-name; for example, the loop identifier <code>i</code>.  Here is
what your list could look like after going 3 times round the outer
loop (the inner loop is on lines 241-244):</p>

<table cellpadding=3 border="0">
<tr><td></td>
<td align="left">tabstops</td>
<td align="left">FFTFFTFFTFFTFFTFFTFFTFFT<span class="math">...</span></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td>
<td align="left">line(ln)</td>
<td align="left"><code>    </code>T</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left"> 
</td>
<td align="left">in line</td>
<td align="left">=>
<code>THEN ch:="A"</code></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left"> 
</td>
<td align="left">op</td>
<td align="left">
<del>1</del>&nbsp;<del>2</del>&nbsp;<del>3</del>&nbsp;<del>4</del>&nbsp;<del>5</del>&nbsp;6</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">

<td align="left">i</td>
<td align="left"><del>1</del>&nbsp;<del>2</del>&nbsp;3</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left"> 
</td>
<td align="left">c</td>
<td align="left"><del>&rarr;</del>&nbsp;<del>&upsilon;</del>&nbsp;T
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Struck-out values have been superceded and &upsilon; denotes a
space. Dry-running is a very useful method, if laborious and
time-consuming, of finding bugs. <tt>tab ch</tt> <a name="8679"></a>
is declared in the standard prelude.</p>

<p>This utility program (<code>lf</code>) is quite short, but we have
analysed its working in detail so that you can see how it is done.</p>

<h2><a name="section001434000000000000000"></a><a name="dev-alien"></a>
<tt>ALIEN</tt> procedures</h2>

<p>The utility <code>lf</code> uses some of the extensions provided by
the a68toc<a name="8681"></a> compiler, in particular, the
<code>ALIEN</code> construct which provides access to procedures
compiled by other compilers. In this section we shall look at the
<code>get cwd</code> and the <code>fstat</code> procedures.</p>

<h3><a name="section001434100000000000000"></a><a name="dev-fstat"></a>
The procedure <tt>fstat</tt></h3>

<p>The procedure <code>fstat</code> is on lines 100-105. It depends on
a call of the <code>linux fstat</code> procedure whose second
parameter is a name referring to a value of mode <code>STAT</code>.
The declaration of <code>STAT</code> is on lines 24-41.</p>

<p>If you investigate the file <code>/usr/include/statbuf.h</code>,
you will find the C&nbsp;definition of the <code>stat</code> structure
therein. The <code>STAT</code> mode accurately reflects this structure
using <code>LONG</code> or <code>SHORT</code> as appropriate. Briefly,
a C&nbsp;<code>unsigned int</code> is equivalent to an Algol 68
<code>BITS</code>. For historical reasons, the&nbsp;C <code>unsigned
long int</code> has the same meaning as an <code>unsigned int</code>
so <code>BITS</code> could have been used for those fields as well.
However, because the value is required as an integer (and is stored as
a positive integer), it is possible to regard them as having mode
<code>INT</code>. Some of the C&nbsp;modes<a name="tex2html43"
href="footnode.html#foot8683"><sup><span
class="arabic">13</span>.<span class="arabic">3</span></sup></a> are
hidden by further mode declarations<a name="tex2html44"
href="footnode.html#foot8684"><sup><span
class="arabic">13</span>.<span class="arabic">4</span></sup></a>, but
if you hunt for <code>__dev_t</code> you will find it is an
<code>unsigned long long int</code> which is equivalent to the Algol
68 <code>LONG BITS</code> or, as is used in <code>STAT</code>,
<code>LONG INT</code>.</p>

<p>Now look at the declaration of <code>linux fstat</code> on lines
85-89.  Most of this construction is C&nbsp;source code. The
<code>ALIEN</code> construct may be written as</p>

<pre>
   &lt;mode&gt; &lt;identifier&gt; = ALIEN "&lt;symbol&gt;"
      "&lt;C source code&gt;";
</pre>

<p>where the angle brackets denote items to be replaced. In the
declaration for <code>linux fstat</code> we have</p>

<ul>
<li><code>&lt;mode&gt; = PROC(INT,REF STAT)INT</code>
</li>
<li><code>&lt;identifier&gt; = linux fstat</code>
</li>
<li><code>&lt;symbol&gt; = FSTAT</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>followed by three lines of C&nbsp;source code. It is not my
intention to delve into the mysteries of C. If you don't understand
that language, consult someone who does. However, the point of the
declaration is to map the Algol 68 modes onto the C&nbsp;equivalents.
The C&nbsp;procedure <code>fstat</code> takes two parameters: the
first has mode <code>int</code> (equivalent to <code>INT</code>) and
the second of mode <code>struct stat*</code> which is equivalent to
<code>REF STAT</code>. The cast in C&nbsp;consists of a mode in
parentheses (compare with the Algol 68 cast in
section&nbsp;<a href="node97.html#gram-prim">10.5</a>) so the third
line of C&nbsp;code ensures that the second parameter of the Algol 68
procedure <code>linux fstat</code> has the right mode. The
<code>A_int_INT(...)</code> construct is a C&nbsp;language
macro<a name="tex2html45"
href="footnode.html#foot8631"><sup><span
class="arabic">13</span>.<span class="arabic">5</span></sup></a> for a
cast which ensures that the yielded C&nbsp;integer is equivalent to
the Algol 68 <code>INT</code>.  If you want to see what the
a68toc<a name="8685"></a> compiler generates, look for
<code>FSTAT</code> in the file <code>lf.c</code>.</p>

<p>Reverting to line 102, the field <code>sys file OF f</code> has the correct
mode for use as the &ldquo;file descriptor&rdquo; for <code>fstat</code>. You should
check the manual page of <code>fstat</code> (in section 2 of the Linux
Programming Manual) for details of its functioning and yield.</p>

<h3><a name="section001434200000000000000"></a><a name="dev-getcwd"></a>
The procedure <tt>get cwd</tt></h3>

<p>The procedure <code>get cwd</code> is more complicated because it
uses several facilities provided by the standard prelude as well as
another extension provided by the a68toc<a name="8687"></a> compiler.
Firstly, look at the <code>ALIEN</code> declaration of <code>linux
getcwd</code> on lines 91-93.  The mode <code>VECTOR[]CHAR</code> is
similar to the mode <code>[]CHAR</code>, but the lower bound is always
1 and is omitted from the generated construct. In fact, a68toc
translates this mode into the C&nbsp;equivalent of</p>

<pre>
   STRUCT(REF CHAR data, INT gc, upb)
</pre>

<p>The <code>gc</code> field is an integer provided for the
garbage-collector (the run-time memory management system which looks
after the heap).  The <code>data</code> field is a reference to the
actual data (in fact it is a memory address)<a name="tex2html46"
href="footnode.html#foot8688"><sup><span
class="arabic">13</span>.<span class="arabic">6</span></sup></a>.</p>

<p>The C&nbsp;procedure <code>getcwd</code> requires two parameters: a
reference to an area which it can use to return the full path of the
current working directory and an integer which states how big that
area is. The C&nbsp;source code in the declaration for <code>linux
getcwd</code> contains the C macro<a name="8641"></a></p>

<pre>
   A_VC_charptr(buf)
</pre>

<p>which expands into <code>buf.data</code> (equivalent to the
Algol&nbsp;68 expression <code>data OF buf</code>) and the
C&nbsp;macro <code>A_INT_int</code> which converts an Algol&nbsp;68
<code>INT</code> into a C&nbsp;<code>int</code> (directly equivalent
on Linux).</p>

<p>The yield of <code>linux getcwd</code> is a reference to the area
in which the current working directory path has been put. Strictly
speaking, this is identical to the first parameter of the
C&nbsp;procedure <code>getcwd</code>, but the GNU C&nbsp;compiler
complains if it is used as such. To get around this, the author used
the cast <code>(void *)</code> which effectively causes the reference
to be a reference to an anonymous piece of memory. The Algol&nbsp;68
equivalent is <code>CPTR</code> which is defined in the standard
prelude as <code>REF BITS</code>.</p>

<p>Now comes the clever bit. Look at line 98. The value of mode
<code>CPTR</code> (<code>REF BITS</code>) is converted by the operator
<code>CPTRTOCSTR</code> into a value of mode <code>CSTR</code>
(declared in the standard prelude as <code>REF STRUCT 16000000
CHAR</code>). Now look at the definition of that operator (on line
95)! <code>BIOP</code> stands for &ldquo;built-in operator&rdquo; and
<code>BIOP 99</code> is the only built-in operator implemented by the
a68toc translator. <code>BIOP 99</code> maps its parameter (of one
mode) onto its yield (of another mode). It effectively acts as a cast
(in this case) from one <code>REF</code> mode to another
<code>REF</code> mode. Have a look at the C&nbsp;source code in
<code>lf.c</code> if you are interested in the details. Then the value
of mode <code>CSTR</code> is converted using the operator
<code>CSTRTORVC</code> to a value of mode <code>REF
VECTOR[]CHAR</code> which is dereferenced and then coerced to a value
of mode <code>STRING</code>. In fact, the a68toc compiler will
silently coerce values of mode <code>REF STRUCT i MODE</code> to mode
<code>REF VECTOR[]MODE</code> and thence to <code>REF[]MODE</code>.
Notice that you cannot coerce a value of mode <code>REF
VECTOR[]MODE</code> to <code>REF FLEX[]MODE</code>. The mode
<code>STRING</code> has no flexibility (it is equivalent to
<code>[]CHAR</code>).</p>

<p>Lastly, note that the parameter of <code>linux getcwd</code> is an
anonymous<a name="8644"></a> <code>VECTOR[]CHAR</code> whose scope
is limited to the scope of <code>get cwd</code> (the Algol&nbsp;68
procedure).</p>

<p>If you want to examine the other macros used for the translated
C&nbsp;source, have a look at the files in the directories</p>
