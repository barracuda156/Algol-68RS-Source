<h1><a name="section001380000000000000000"></a><a name="adv-queues"></a>
Queues</h1>

<p>Consider<a name="7758"></a> the problem of representing a queue.
We shall suppose that the queue is at a football match and that each
fan in the queue has a name, in the ordinary sense, and a ticket
number.  Rather than just present the solution to this problem, we
shall discuss the problem in detail and show why the solution is what
it is.</p>

<p>A suitable mode for the fan would be
<tt>FAN</tt><a name="7989"></a>:</p>

<pre>
   MODE FAN = STRUCT(STRING name,INT ticket)
</pre>

<p>but what would be a suitable declaration for a queue? At first sight,
it would appear that a flexible name<a name="7763"></a> which can
refer to a multiple of fans would be suitable:</p>

<pre>
   MODE QUEUE = FLEX[1:0]FAN
</pre>

<p>but there are difficulties. Firstly, the only way a new fan could be
added to the queue would be to assign a whole new multiple to a name
(in the Algol&nbsp;68 sense) referring to the queue:</p>

<pre>
   QUEUE q; q:=q+FAN("Jim",1)
</pre>

<p>assuming that the operator <code>+</code> has been declared with the header
<pre>
   OP + = ([]QUEUE a,FAN b)[]QUEUE:
</pre>

<p>If the queue were long, this would be very inefficient. Secondly,
given a particular fan, how would we find the fan behind him or her?
Knowing the subscript of the fan would seem to be the answer, but what
happens if someone joins the queue somewhere in front of the fan in
question?  Given that there might be several fans under consideration,
the program would have to update all the relevant subscripts and keep
a record of which subscripts would be relevant.</p>

<p>The solution is to represent a queue as a recursive
structure<a name="7770"></a>:</p>

<pre>
   MODE QUEUE=STRUCT(FAN fan,REF QUEUE next)
</pre>

<p>Then a queue with two fans in it could be represented by the diagram

<div align="center"><img align="bottom" border="0"
 src="ch11-2.png" alt="ch11-2.png">
</div>

<p>where the mode of each box is <tt>QUEUE</tt><a name="7990"></a> and
<code>F</code> and <code>RQ</code> stand for <code>FAN</code> and
<code>REF QUEUE</code> respectively.  Notice that the
<code>next</code> field of the first structure refers to the structure
on its right.  The <code>next</code> field of the second structure
does not refer to anything.</p>

<p>From the declaration of the mode <code>QUEUE</code>, we can see
that the <code>next</code> field of the structure is a name with mode
<code>REF QUEUE</code>. It would appear that it is possible to
construct a queue in the way depicted by the last diagram: each
<code>next</code> field of each structure would refer to the next
structure (of mode <code>QUEUE</code>) and the last <code>next</code>
field would have the mode <code>REF QUEUE</code> and value
<code>NIL</code>.</p>

<p>Now consider adding another <code>QUEUE</code> to the right-hand
end of the queue. We immediately run into a difficulty. The value of
the <code>next</code> field of the last <code>QUEUE</code> is
<code>NIL</code> with mode <code>REF QUEUE</code>. However, we cannot
assign to <code>NIL</code>, nor can we replace the
name<a name="7778"></a> <tt>NIL</tt><a name="7991"></a> with another
name to make it refer to a new <code>QUEUE</code>. The reason is that
a name of mode <code>REF QUEUE</code> can only be replaced by another
name of mode <code>REF QUEUE</code> if the first name is referred to
by a name of mode <code>REF REF QUEUE</code>. In other words, instead
of making the structures have mode <code>QUEUE</code>, we should make
them have mode <code>REF QUEUE</code>.  In
section&nbsp;<a href="node67.html#struc-field">7.2</a>, on field
selection, we pointed out that the modes of the fields of a structure
name are all preceded by a <code>REF</code>. This also applies to a
recursively-defined structure. In this case, the mode of the
<code>next</code> field becomes <code>REF REF QUEUE</code> and could
refer to <code>NIL</code> (with mode <code>REF QUEUE</code>) or to
another structure of mode <code>REF QUEUE</code>. We can depict this
as</p>

<div align="center"><img align="bottom" border="0"
 src="ch11-3.png" alt="ch11-3.png">
</div>

<p>where <code>RQ</code>, <code>RRQ</code> and <code>RF</code>
represent the modes <code>REF QUEUE</code>, <code>REF</code>
<code>REF</code> <code>QUEUE</code> and <code>REF FAN</code>
respectively.</p>

<p>Now let us consider how such a queue could be created. Since the
length of the queue at the time the program is written is unknown (and
will change as fans join or leave the queue), it is not possible to
have an identifier for each structure forming the queue. Instead, we
can create anonymous names using a generator<a name="7785"></a>.
However, we must be able to refer to the queue in order to manipulate
it. Let us declare a name, identified by <code>head</code>, to refer
to the beginning of the queue:</p>

<pre>
   REF QUEUE head:=NIL
</pre>

<p>We have made it refer to <tt>NIL</tt><a name="7992"></a> (with mode
<code>REF QUEUE</code>) because the queue is currently empty. Using the
suggestion of the last section, we shall declare</p>

<pre>
   REF QUEUE nilq = NIL;
   REF QUEUE head:=nilq
</pre>

<p>where <code>head</code> has the mode <code>REF REF
QUEUE</code>.</p>

<p>Let us assign the first fan to the queue:</p>

<pre>
   head:=LOC QUEUE:=(("Jim",1),nilq)
</pre>

<p>We can represent this by the diagram</p>

<div align="center"><img align="bottom" border="0"
 src="ch11-4.png"
 alt="ch11-4.png">
</div>

<p>We can now assign another fan to the queue:</p>

<pre>
   next OF head:=LOC QUEUE:=(("Fred",2),nilq)
</pre>

<p>Let us be quite clear what is happening here. The mode of
<code>head</code> is <code>REF REF QUEUE</code>. It is a name which
refers to a name so it has no fields. We can select
fields<a name="7799"></a> only from a <code>QUEUE</code> or a
<code>REF QUEUE</code>. However, the context of a
selection<a name="7800"></a> is weak<a name="7801"></a>(see
section&nbsp;<a href="node95.html#gram-coercions">10.3</a>) and so
only weak-dereferencing is allowed<a name="7803"></a>. Thus in</p>

<pre>
   next OF head
</pre>

<p><code>head</code> is dereferenced to mode <code>REF QUEUE</code>
and the <code>next</code> field selected (with mode <code>REF REF
QUEUE</code>). The anonymous name <code>LOC QUEUE</code> has mode
<code>REF QUEUE</code>, so the structure display (with mode
<code>QUEUE</code>) is assigned to it, and it in turn is assigned to
<code>next OF head</code> without dereferencing.  This means that the
<code>nilq</code> which <code>next OF head</code> referred to after
the first fan <code>("Jim",1)</code> was added to the queue has been
replaced by the second <code>LOC</code> <code>QUEUE</code> which is
what we wanted. We can now depict the queue by</p>

<div align="center"><img align="bottom" border="0"
 src="ch11-5.png" alt="ch11-5.png">
</div>

<p>We could now extend the queue by writing</p>

<pre>
   next OF next OF queue:=LOC QUEUE
</pre>

<p>but since we do not know how long the queue might become, clearly
we cannot go on writing</p>

<pre>
   next OF next OF ...
</pre>

<p>What we need is some way of referring to the tail of the queue without
lots of selections. Because the tail of the queue always has mode
<code>REF REF QUEUE</code> (it is the <code>next</code> field of a
<code>REF QUEUE</code>), what we need is a name of mode
<code>REF REF REF QUEUE</code> (yes, three <code>REF</code>s). Here
it is:</p>

<pre>
   REF REF QUEUE tail;
</pre>

<p>but again we run into a difficulty (the last one). When the queue
is empty, <code>head</code> refers to <code>nilq</code>, but what does
<code>tail</code> refer to since we cannot select from
<code>nilq</code> (because it is <code>NIL</code>)? The solution is to
make <code>head</code> have the mode <code>REF REF REF QUEUE</code> as
well as <code>tail</code> and generate a name of mode <code>REF REF
QUEUE</code> to refer to <code>nilq</code>! (bear with it, we're
almost there):</p>

<pre>
   tail:=head:=LOC REF QUEUE:=nilq
</pre>

<p>In this triple assignment, only <code>head</code> is dereferenced.
We can depict this as</p>

<div align="center"><img align="bottom" border="0"
 src="ch11-6.png" alt="ch11-6.png">
</div>

<p>Now we can assign the first fan to the head of the queue:</p>

<pre>
   REF REF QUEUE(head):=LOC QUEUE:=
         (("Jim",1),nilq))
</pre>

<p>and make <code>tail</code> refer to the tail of the queue with</p>

<pre>
   tail:=next OF head
</pre>

<p>in which <code>head</code> is dereferenced twice, but the
selection<a name="7824"></a> is not dereferenced at all. The queue can
now be depicted as shown below.</p>

<div align="center"><img align="bottom" border="0"
