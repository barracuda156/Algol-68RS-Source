Literate Programming</a>
</h1>

<p>
The central problem of documenting software is keeping the
documentation up-to-date.  It is accepted by most software engineers
that documentation is an unfortunate necessity.  It is probable that
this general attitude is engendered by enormous documents which are
separate from the code they describe.  With this attitude, some way of
closely relating documentation to the software it describes is very
desirable. A literate programming system provides a means of
interleaving documentation with source code so that you are presented
with small amounts of documentation for small amounts of code--the
ancient Roman maxim of
<div align="CENTER">
divide and conquer

</div>
seems peculiarly relevant here.

<p>
The Web 68 literate programming system not only provides a means of
keeping system documentation up-to-date, but also makes it easier to
develop large programs.  One of the bugbears of modern compilation
systems is the tendency to write large programs as a collection of
small files.  This causes considerable complexities in the code, never
mind in the documentation of such code, which, sadly, is rarely
provided.  Writers of large programs written in a high-level
programming language tend to write large files.  Keeping track of
identifiers and similar syntactic constructs can be facilitated by a
literate programming system.  Web 68 provides extensive
cross-referencing of identifiers, mode indicants and operator
indicants which help you to keep your bearings.  Coupled with a
powerful macro facility, Web 68 makes it easier to write programs in
sections where each section is accompanied by its own documentation.

<p>
Ideally, one would like to use HTML to produce the documentation and
Algol 68 to write the program.  Web 68 provides a means of combining
both HTML and Algol 68 as a single document which can be
processed by two programs, tang and weav, to produce
Algol 68 and HTML source code respectively: the former as source code
ready for compilation, the latter ready for displaying in a
web browser.

<p>
Web 68 is firmly based on the <span  class="textit">Web System of Structured
Documentation</span> created by Donald E. Knuth for writing his <span class="logo-TeX">T<small>E</small>X</span>&nbsp;and
Metafont typsetting system.  In accordance with Algol 68 practice, the
original programs <span  class="textit">tangle</span> and <span  class="textit">weave</span>
have been abbreviated
to tang and weav respectively. However, you should note
that both tang and weav have been rewritten from scratch
in Algol 68 so, although they have similar functionality to the
original programs, they provide that functionality using different
algorithms.
