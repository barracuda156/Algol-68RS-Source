                         How to install Algol68toC
                         =========================
1. Terminology

In what follows, three terms are used specifically:-

   Algol68toC -- refers to the complete Algol68toC package
   a68toc     -- refers to the Algol68toC compiler
   m file     -- refers to those files produced by `a68toc' whose file
                 extension is `.m'.

2. Programs

You will need the following programs:-
       fakeroot, make, gcc, ld, ldconfig
       latex, makeinfo, tex, texindex
       ar, ranlib, tar
       cp, mv, rm, find, sh

The build was successful with Debian GNU/Linux using a 
3.2.0-2-686-pae kernel.

3. Header files

You will need the header files from the following package:-
          libc6-dev
Note that the build uses /usr/include/linux.

4. Debian

Issue the commands:-
	export A68_NAMESEED=nameseed (for bash or sh)
	make dist-clean
	dpkg-buildpackage -F
to construct the Debian binary package and source tarball.

5. Amending the source

If you find a need to amend the Algol 68 source, please ensure that you add
your name (and organisation, if relevant) to the amendments list at the start
of the relevant source file. The maintainer of the Algol68toC package would be
pleased to hear of any amendments which you have made which would be of general
use.

NOTES
(1) The library `liba68prel.a', produced in the early part of the
`make', is only used for `a68toc'. It is NOT part of the
installation and cannot be used by user programs unless the user
cares to document the routines therein. Far better to use the
standard prelude which has all the functionality and more.

(2) The licence is essentially GNU although not written as such.
However, the licence for the QAD Standard Prelude is the GNU GPL
(version 2 or later).

(3) I should like to hear from you if you find any bugs.
